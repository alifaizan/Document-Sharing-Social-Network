File Sharing Network
The goal of this team project is to come up with a simulation environment for a document-sharing social network. In this environment, users will be able to search for documents, rank the search results according to various criteria, and “like” documents, as in Facebook. The social network is the result of users “following” each other, as in Twitter. We can represent a user’s taste by a simple string (e.g., “jazz”), and a document will similarly have a “tag” string, unknown to the user until the document is evaluated by the user. Logically, a user should “like” a document when its tag matches the user’s taste. The simulation should help us observe the evolution of the site over time, i.e. whether there is an incentive for “liking” documents, “following” other users, and whether it is possible for certain users to influence other users into using their own files
